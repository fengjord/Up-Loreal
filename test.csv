4,229200919,"It was a bit thinner than I anticipated but I think that might be because of the sunscreen component. The product smells amazing and did not leave a greasy residue! I would be in full support of this product if it was not Garnier. Although this product is a green lab product and is not tested on animals, most other Garnier products are. This makes it hard to support giving them any money which could be put towards products tested on animals. I wish all their products were cruelty free.",3.0,Good,"['It was a bit thinner than I anticipated but I think that might be because of the sunscreen component.', 'The product smells amazing and did not leave a greasy residue!', 'I would be in full support of this product if it was not Garnier.', 'Although this product is a green lab product and is not tested on animals, most other Garnier products are.', 'This makes it hard to support giving them any money which could be put towards products tested on animals.', 'I wish all their products were cruelty free.']"

6,229291864,"I received this product for free from topbox circle in exchange for my honest review.
I¡¯ve been using this product for the past week and I can already tell a slight difference in how my skin is looking. I¡¯ve been using this brightening serum and the garnier gel wash at the same time, so I¡¯m not sure which product made the biggest difference, but I think they both did an equally amazing job, as they work great together. My skin feels a lot smoother and I noticed an improvement in how my skin tone looks, it¡¯s more even and brighter. I love that it has SPF 30 as well as Vitamin C. Overall a great product so far, I¡¯ll have to keep using it, as I think it¡¯s a good product for my combo and sensitive skin. #freeproduct",5.0,Great quality,"['I received this product for free from topbox circle in exchange for my honest review.', 'I¡¯ve been using this product for the past week and I can already tell a slight difference in how my skin is looking.', 'I¡¯ve been using this brightening serum and the garnier gel wash at the same time, so I¡¯m not sure which product made the biggest difference, but I think they both did an equally amazing job, as they work great together.', 'My skin feels a lot smoother and I noticed an improvement in how my skin tone looks, it¡¯s more even and brighter.', 'I love that it has SPF 30 as well as Vitamin C.

10,229557252,"Great lotion! However, the scent is very strong. If you don¡¯t like the lotions with a strong smell, I don¡¯t think it would be the best fit for you. Overall, it didn¡¯t leave my skin dry so, it does the job! It met my expectations and I have been on the hunt for a good lotion with SPF so I think I found it with this product. I will purchase it in the future once I have used this one up.
